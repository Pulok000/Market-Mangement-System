# Market Management System

The Market Management System is a Java-based application that implements object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, and interfaces. The system also includes file handling and user-defined packages.In addition, the system also implements exception handling to provide better error handling and user feedback.

## Introduction

The Market Management System is designed to store and manage a large volume of information related to market management. This includes employee information, shop information, product information, and more. The system replaces manual paper-based systems, providing an effective and efficient service.

## Problem Analysis

The system helps solve the problem of storing and managing market-related information in a fast, accurate, and systematic way. By using the system, there is a lower risk of system failure, and users can search for specific data within seconds. The Market Management System is specifically designed for people who handle market management tasks.

## UI Design Analysis

The Market Management System interacts with users through the Command Line Interface, where users input commands representing different operations. The system runs different operations based on user inputs. However, a Graphical User Interface would be more user-friendly and improve the overall user experience.

## Logical Analysis

The application implements various code logic to ensure proper functioning. For example, when adding a new quantity, the system checks whether the amount is greater than zero or not. If it is, the system subtracts from the previously available quantity instead of adding a new quantity. When selling a quantity, the system checks whether the selling amount is greater than zero and smaller than the available quantity. However, the system does not check for duplicate values in shop ID, product ID, or employee ID.

## OOP Concept Analysis

The application implements the four main principles of object-oriented programming: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Encapsulation is achieved using setter and getter methods. Inheritance is used in many classes. Polymorphism involves overriding many methods, and the system includes abstract classes and methods to implement abstraction.

## Impact of this Project

The Market Management System can help markets develop their services, fast-forward the entire management system, and increase customer interest in markets. The risk of losing important data is also reduced, leading to increased profitability and growth in the industry. The system's use of computer-based technology can have a positive impact on the economy and society.

## Limitations and Possible Future Improvements

The Command Line Interface is not the most user-friendly interface, and there is a risk of closing the application due to incorrect user input. Future improvements could include adding a Graphical User Interface and implementing a database to store data more efficiently. 

Overall, the Market Management System is a reliable, efficient, and effective solution for managing market-related information.
